//! Multi-threaded garbage-collected pointers. 'Gc' stands for 'Garbage
//! Collected'.
//!
//! The type [`Gc<T>`][`Gc`] provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
//! allocated in the heap. [`Gc`] pointers are copyable, with copied [`Gc`]s
//! pointing to the same allocation in the heap.
//!
//! The allocation referenced by a [`Gc`] pointer is guaranteed not to be
//! dropped while there are still references to it. When there are no longer any
//! references, the garbage collector will drop it, calling any finalisers (in
//! non-deterministic order) in another thread. The garbage collector runs
//! intermittently in the background, so [`Gc`] pointers may live longer than
//! they need to, and cannot be relied on to drop values deterministically.
//!
//! Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and [`Gc`] is no
//! exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to something
//! inside an [`Gc`]. If you need mutability, put a [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`]
//! inside the [`Gc`].
//!
//! Unlike [`Rc`], cycles between [`Gc`] pointers are allowed and can be
//! deallocated without issue.
//!
//! If the `T` in a [`Gc`] has a [`Drop`] method, it will be run using a
//! finalizer before being deallocated.
//!
//! `Gc<T>` automatically dereferences to `T` (via the [`Deref`] trait), so you
//! can call `T`'s methods on a value of type [`Gc<T>`][`Gc`]. To avoid name
//! clashes with `T`'s methods, the methods of [`Gc<T>`][`Gc`] itself are
//! associated functions, called using [fully qualified syntax].
//!
//! [`Cell`]: core::cell::Cell
//! [`RefCell`]: core::cell::RefCell
//! [send]: core::marker::Send
